# Feature: Fractions


## Scenario_1:

**Given**: two fractional numbers just with the numerator. <br>
**When**: calculation is performed. <br>
**Then**: return should be result of calculation. <br>

## Scenario_2:

**Given**: two fractional numbers with the same denominators. <br>
**When**: calculation is performed. <br>
**Then**: return should be result of calculation. <br>

## Scenario_3:

**Given**: two fractional numbers with the different denominators. <br>
**When**: calculation is performed. <br>
**Then**: return should be result of calculation. <br>


## Scenario_4:

**Given**: two fractional numbers. <br>
**When**: calculation is performed and numerator greater than denominator. <br>
**Then**: result should be represented in the form of: "whole_number numerator/denominator". <br>
